# Fence Construction Requirements – How to Avoid Trouble?

Although a fence is classified as a simple structure, its construction is not always as simple as it might seem. In certain cases, fence installation is restricted or must meet specific legal act requirements. If these rules are ignored, you may not only have to correct violations but also completely demolish the fence.

Therefore, before starting any plot enclosure work, it's necessary to familiarize yourself with the current requirements.

## Main Requirements for Fence Construction

In some cases, you may need:

- **written consent of the adjacent plot owner**,
- **municipality-issued building permit document (SLD)**.

These requirements are intended to ensure:

- surface water runoff,
- sufficient sunlight access to neighboring plots,
- protection of neighbors' interests.

Experienced fence masters automatically follow these rules, so by choosing professionals you can avoid many potential problems.

## When is No Permit Needed?

A building permit document or neighbor consent is **not needed** if:

- the fence is **lower than 2 m**,
- the fence is **more than 1 m away from the plot border**,
- the fence **meets insolation requirements**.

In all other cases, consent or permit may be required.

---

## When is Neighbor's Written Consent Needed?

Neighbor consent is necessary if:

### **1. Fence is built closer than 1 m from the plot border**

Or if any part of the fence structure crosses the plot border.

### **2. Fence Opacity Exceeds Allowed Limits**

Opacity requirements depend on shadow direction:

- **< 50% openings** (i.e. >50% solid) – if shadow falls **northward** (330°–30°).
- **< 25% openings** (i.e. >75% solid) – if shadow falls **eastward** (30°–90°) or **westward** (270°–330°).

These requirements apply **only when** the fence is **closer than 1 m** from the plot border.

### **Practical Example**

If you want to build a **solid 1–2 m high fence**, you have two options:

1. build it **no closer than 1 m** from the plot border, or
2. obtain **neighbor's written consent**.

## Surface Water Runoff Requirements

A fence with a plinth **cannot obstruct** surface water runoff between plots.  
If the fence creates an obstacle, the fence builder must:

- obtain neighbor consent **and**
- install surface water runoff system (to a ditch, drainage, rainwater drainage).

If such a system cannot be installed, it's necessary to find a solution acceptable to both parties.

### Important

If the plot owner changes, **previous written consents remain valid** and are transferred to the new owner.

---

## When is Municipality Building Permit (SLD) Needed?

A building permit document is needed when:

### **1. Fence is higher than 2 m**

This is one of the most common cases when SLD is mandatory.

### **2. Fence is built in protected territories**

For example:

- cultural heritage object territories,
- cultural heritage sites,
- nature heritage object zones,
- state parks,
- reserves,
- strict nature reserves,
- biosphere reserve buffer zones.

### **3. Exceptional Cases**

Even a fence up to 2 m high may require a permit if it's built:

- in cultural heritage protection zones,
- in the Curonian Spit,
- in resorts,
- in "Natura 2000" territories (if not built in a homestead).

## Conclusion

Fence construction may seem simple, but by improperly assessing requirements, you can face serious problems – from conflicts with neighbors to mandatory fence demolition.  
By following established rules and, if necessary, consulting with specialists, you can ensure that the fence will be built legally, safely and without additional worries.
