# How to Choose the Ideal Fence According to Your Plot’s Terrain?

Choosing a fence is not only an aesthetic decision, but also a practical task that requires taking the specifics of the plot into account. If your plot has uneven terrain or you face complex environmental conditions, choosing the right fence can be a challenge. However, properly selected fence segments can not only highlight the aesthetics of the area but also ensure functionality.

## Why Is Terrain Important When Choosing a Fence?

The plot’s terrain is one of the main factors determining the choice of a suitable fence. If your area is uneven or has slopes:

- **Adaptation to slopes** – segment fences perfectly adapt to these conditions.
- **Stepped segments or freely following the slope** – installation can be straight or “stepped.”
- **Efficient use of space** – a properly planned fence helps to optimally use the territory.

## How Can Wind Direction and Sunlight Affect Your Fence Choice?

- **Wind resistance** – choose segments with smaller gaps or aerodynamic solutions.
- **Privacy from the sun** – denser segments or decorative elements increase shade and privacy.
