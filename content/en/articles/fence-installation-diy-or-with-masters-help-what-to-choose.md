Many homeowners want to contribute to the care of their home and yard themselves. Naturally, when the need arises to install a fence, the first question arises – is it possible to install it yourself?

## Permits for Fence Construction

A fence is classified as **simple structures category**, but in certain cases you may need:

- **neighbor's written consent**,
- **municipality building permit document (SLD)**.

### When Is Neighbor Consent Needed?

If the fence is installed:

- **on the plot border**,
- **closer than 1 m from the border**,  
  — neighbor's written consent is necessary.

If the fence is installed **1 m or more away**, no additional consents are needed.

### When Is SLD Needed?

A permit is necessary if:

- the fence is higher than **2 meters**,
- the fence is installed in **cultural heritage territory**,
- the fence is installed on **state land**.

## Fence Post Installation

Posts are one of the most important fence structure elements.  
They must be:

- concreted **about 60 cm** deep (or one-third of post height),
- reinforced with proper concrete and gravel mixture,
- stable and resistant to loads.

Properly installed posts ensure that the fence will withstand:

- wind gusts,
- rain,
- snow,
- other intense weather condition loads.

## Underground Utility Pipes and Electrical Cables

Before digging holes for posts, it's necessary to clarify:

- whether there are electrical cables on the plot,
- gas pipes,
- water supply,
- other utility networks.

Not knowing their location, you can:

- damage utilities,
- create danger to yourself and neighbors,
- incur large additional expenses.

---

## Surface Waters

The fence structure **must not obstruct** surface water runoff between plots.  
If the fence blocks water drainage, it's necessary to:

- install water diversion solutions,
- ensure that no damage is done to the neighbor.

This is one of the most often forgotten but extremely important aspects.

## Equipment Needed for Fence Installation

For DIY installation, specialized tools are needed:

- earth auger,
- concrete mixer,
- leveling equipment,
- cutting and fastening tools.

Most people don't have these, and rental can be expensive.  
Fence masters have all necessary equipment and can ensure professional results.

## Fence Installation: Is It Really Worth Doing Yourself?

Although the desire to do everything yourself is understandable, fence installation often requires:

- practical skills,
- quick decisions on site,
- experience with different soil types,
- knowledge of construction requirements.

Masters who have both theoretical and practical knowledge can:

- quickly solve arising nuances,
- ensure the fence is installed correctly,
- avoid mistakes that can be costly,
- adapt solutions individually to the situation.

Therefore, in most cases, it's worth trusting fence installation to professionals – this way you'll avoid risks and ensure a durable result.
