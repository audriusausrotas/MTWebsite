# Save Space in Yard: Sliding and Folding Automatic Yard Gates

Private yard – a place where you want as much space as possible for relaxation, cars and landscaping.  
However, in many plots, the entrance area becomes the biggest challenge: not enough space to park a car, difficult to pass, and traditional gates take up too much area.  
Modern **automatic yard gates** – sliding and folding – allow solving these problems elegantly and functionally.

## Sliding Automatic Yard Gates

Sliding gates are one of the most popular choices in Lithuania.  
They move horizontally along the fence, therefore do not require any additional space for gates to open.

### Why Do Sliding Gates Save Space?

#### **1. No Turning Radius**

Unlike swing gates, sliding gates do not need free space for opening.  
This allows:

- parking car closer to fence,
- conveniently planning landscaping,
- using every yard centimeter.

#### **2. Suitable for Both Narrow and Very Wide Entrances**

Sliding gates work perfectly:

- in narrow plots,
- in entrances up to **8 meters** wide,
- in places where it's important not to block road or sidewalk.

Since gates slide parallel to fence, they don't obstruct either cars or pedestrians – this is especially relevant when living near busy street.

## Folding Automatic Yard Gates

Folding (accordion) gates are an excellent solution when yard space is limited and there's no room for sliding gates to move sideways.

### How Do They Save Space?

#### **1. Individually Adjustable Number of Panels**

Gates can be made of:

- 2,
- 3,
- 4 or more folding parts.

This allows adapting gates even to very small spaces.

#### **2. Compact Folding Inward**

When opened, gates fold into a narrow package, therefore:

- do not take up yard space,
- do not require large opening area,
- perfect for small plots or limited zones.

This is a modern and rarer solution that gives the yard exclusivity.
