# Fence Hanging Foundations – Why Do You Need Them?

## What Are Hanging Foundations?

Hanging foundations, also called **modular foundations**, are elements that complement the fence structure and serve as a stable base and support system.  
They are manufactured in a factory, therefore characterized by:

- consistent quality,
- precise shapes,
- quick installation,
- durability.

One of their biggest advantages – **time and money savings**. Since foundations are standardized and prepared for installation, no on-site concreting or complex preparation work is needed.

## What Characteristics Do Hanging Foundations Have?

When choosing hanging foundations, it's worth evaluating several essential aspects.

### **1. Adaptation to Climate and Soil**

Different regions have different conditions: temperature fluctuations, moisture changes, soil instability.  
Hanging foundations:

- don't crack with weather changes,
- adapt to soil movement,
- maintain aesthetic appearance for many years.

This is a big advantage over on-site poured foundations.

### **2. Stability and Strength**

For high or heavy fences (e.g., steel, forged), a strong base is necessary.  
Hanging foundations:

- ensure structure stability,
- withstand variable weather conditions,
- help avoid fence bending or settling.

### **3. Aesthetic Appearance**

Modular foundations can be:

- various designs,
- different colors,
- adapted to fence style.

This allows creating a unified, tidy and modern plot appearance.

### **4. Economical Solution**

Compared to traditional foundations:

- no on-site concreting needed,
- labor costs are reduced,
- installation is faster,
- total project cost becomes lower.

This is one of the most rational choices for both private and commercial projects.

## How Are Hanging Foundations Installed?

To ensure durability, installation must be done precisely and consistently.

### **Installation Process:**

1. **Dig holes** for fence posts.
2. **Install support posts**, leveling them and firmly securing.
3. **Attach hanging holders** to the posts.
4. **Hang foundations** on holders, ensuring they are evenly distributed.
5. The foundation part should be:
   - **about 10 cm buried in ground**,
   - **8–10 cm visible outside**,
   - total height – **about 20 cm**.

This installation method ensures stability and aesthetic fence line.
