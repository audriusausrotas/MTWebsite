# Fence Construction: Most Important Steps from Hole Drilling to Final Finishing

Fence construction is a process that requires precision, planning and proper technological solutions.  
Steel fences today are one of the most popular choices due to their durability, easy maintenance and modern design.  
For a fence to serve for many years, it's necessary to follow the main construction stages – from hole drilling to final finishing.

Below we present a clear and professional guide to steel fence construction steps.

## Steel Fence Design and Material Selection

Before starting work, it's important to evaluate:

- what height fence is needed,
- what design you want to adapt,
- what is the plot's purpose and architectural style.

Steel fences are made from:

- **galvanized steel**,
- **aluminum steel**,
- with various protective coatings.

The **Thyssenkrupp steel** we use is characterized by extremely high quality and has a **45-year warranty**, therefore ensures longevity even in difficult weather conditions.

## Post Hole Drilling: Recommended Depth and Width

Properly installed posts are the foundation of fence stability.

### Recommended Hole Depth:

- **60–90 cm**,
- or **at least 1/3 of post length**,
- in cold regions – even deeper holes to avoid ground movement due to frost.

### Recommended Hole Width:

- **20–30 cm**,
- to ensure sufficient concrete amount and strong bonding with ground.

## Base Preparation and Concreting Work

After preparing holes, the following steps are performed:

1. **A gravel layer is poured at the bottom** – it improves drainage and protects the post from water accumulation.
2. **Posts are installed and leveled** using a laser or string.
3. **Concrete is poured in layers** so it compacts evenly and fills the entire hole.
4. **Posts are fixed** until concrete completely hardens.

Such base preparation ensures that the fence will remain stable even in strong wind or temperature changes.

## Steel Fence Installation and Segment Fastening

When concrete hardens, fence segment installation begins.

- Segments are installed so the fence is at the same level.
- **special brackets** are used, ensuring strong and long-lasting connection.
- It's recommended to choose **anti-corrosion brackets** that protect from rust and extend fence's service life.

## Final Finishing and Corrosion Protection

Steel fence finishing is not only aesthetics but also protection.

Steel is usually:

- **galvanized**,
- **coated with protective polymer layer**,
- **powder-coated** according to RAL color palette.

Powder coating:

- protects from corrosion,
- doesn't fade,
- provides a unified and aesthetic appearance.

---

## Fence Maintenance and Longevity Assurance

Steel fences require minimal maintenance, however it's recommended to:

- periodically wash away dust and dirt,
- inspect for damaged segments,
- check post caps to prevent water from entering inside,
- trim branches that can scratch the surface.

Regular inspection helps notice damage in time and avoid larger repair work.

## Finally

Fence construction is a process where every step is important: from hole drilling and concreting to segment installation and final finishing.  
Following these principles, the steel fence will be not only durable and stable but also an aesthetic part of your plot, serving for many years.
