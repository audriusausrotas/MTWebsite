# Fences and Their History in Lithuania: What Can We Learn from Ancestors?

Fences in Lithuania are not just a practical solution but also an important cultural symbol reflecting different epochs' lifestyles, architecture and people's needs.  
Although today we mostly understand fences as security and privacy measures, in ancient times they performed many more functions.  
Let's see how fences changed over the centuries and what ideas we can apply in our homesteads today.

## Fence Evolution from Ancient Times to Present Day

### Ancient Times – Vital Necessity

The purpose of the first fences was clear – **protection from enemies and wild animals**.  
Fences fortified hillforts, where settlements formed on their peaks.  
Most often wood was used, and fence types throughout Lithuania were quite similar.

This period marks the emergence of fences and their spread throughout the country's territory.

### Middle Ages – Wood, Stone and Masonry

In the Middle Ages, fence types depended on architectural style:

- wooden fences,
- stone fences,
- brick masonry fences.

During Baroque and Classicism periods, **ornate brick fences** appeared with:

- balustrades,
- arches,
- decorative elements.

Some of these fences were later used as building walls or porches.

### Until 20th Century – Variety of Wooden Fences

Various types of wooden fences dominated in Lithuanian villages, intended for:

- homesteads,
- gardens,
- meadows,
- pastures,
- orchards,
- separating yard areas.

The most widespread were **wicker fences**, made from birch or other flexible branches.

#### Weaving Types:

- **Vertical weaving** – for homesteads, orchards, gardens.
- **Horizontal weaving** – for fields, enclosures, meadows.

In coastal regions, fishermen's homesteads were enclosed with **old fishing nets** – a practical solution reflecting local traditions.

### 20th Century – New Types and Materials

Appeared:

- panel fences,
- forged fences,
- horizontal slatted fences (trellises).

Pastures were enclosed with trellis fences, and denser ones – yards, fields and orchards.  
In Samogitia, **half-horizontal slatted fences** became especially popular, used even to separate fields.

Later spread:

- **fieldstone fences**,
- **dolomite fences**,
- **barbed wire fences**,
- **mesh net fences**,
- **steel fences**.

Although they were simpler back then, today steel fences have become a modern, durable and aesthetic solution.

## Purpose of Fences in Ancient Times – Not Just Protection

Fences also performed a decorative function.  
Lithuanians liked to decorate gardens and vegetable patches with **low woven fences**.  
The "good" side of the yard – the one visible from the street – was enclosed with a more beautiful, ornate fence.

This tradition reveals Lithuanians' desire to create a tidy, aesthetic environment – a trait that has survived to this day.

## What Can We Adopt from Ancestors?

Although modern fences usually enclose the entire plot and decorative fences are rarely used, ancient solutions can be excellent inspiration.

### Ideas That Can Be Applied Today:

- woven fences in single homesteads – authentic and cozy solution,
- stone fences – durable and naturally blending into landscape,
- decorative fences for gardens – subtle reflection of traditions,
- integration of wooden elements into modern fences.

Such solutions help maintain connection with Lithuanian tradition and give the homestead exclusivity.
