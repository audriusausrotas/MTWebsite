## Advantages of Clinker Tiles

### Durability

Clinker tiles are one of the most durable finishing materials on the market.  
Due to special production technology, they are characterized by:

- extremely high hardness,
- resistance to temperature fluctuations,
- minimal water absorption (only **2–5 %**),
- resistance to salt, frost and UV rays,
- non-combustibility.

This ensures the facade remains unchanged for decades, even in harsh Lithuanian climate.

### No Maintenance Required

Tiles are fired at about **1200 °C** temperature, therefore:

- they do not fade,
- they do not crack,
- they do not require impregnation or painting,
- they maintain original appearance without additional effort.

This is one of the biggest advantages of clinker tiles.

### Variety of Colors and Textures

Clinker tiles can be:

- cream,
- yellow,
- brown,
- red,
- dark or even graphite colored.

Since natural clay and minerals are used in production, each tile has subtle color nuances.  
This allows creating an **authentic, naturally looking facade** that cannot be replicated with synthetic materials.

### Eco-friendliness

Clinker tiles are made from:

- natural clay,
- minerals,
- without any chemical additives.

They:

- do not harm health,
- do not cause allergies,
