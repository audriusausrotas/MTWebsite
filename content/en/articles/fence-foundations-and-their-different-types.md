A fence is not only a guarantee of safety and privacy but also an important part of territory aesthetics. For a fence to be stable, strong and serve for many years, it's necessary to properly choose and install fence foundations.  
Foundations are the structure's base that holds the entire fence's weight, so their choice must be well-thought-out. Today we discuss the most popular fence foundation types and their differences.

## Strip Monolithic Fence Foundations

Strip foundations are one of the classic and most often chosen solutions, especially when the fence is:

- made of concrete blocks,
- bricks,
- fence panels,
- massive structures.

### How Are They Installed?

- **50–80 cm** deep holes are dug.
- Wooden forms are placed.
- Crushed stone base is laid.
- Reinforcement is placed.
- Concrete is poured.
- On slopes, foundations are formed **stepped principle**.

### Important to Know

After winter, strip foundations can **crack**, therefore they require periodic maintenance. This is a strong but more maintenance-requiring solution.

## Drilled Foundations

Drilled foundations are chosen when the fence is not very heavy. They are perfect for:

- segmental fences,
- wooden fences,
- net fences.

### How Are They Installed?

- Holes are dug in ground for posts.
- Depth – about **1/3 of post length**.
- Post is installed.
- Hole is filled with concrete.

This is an economical and fast solution that ensures sufficient stability for lighter fences.

## Combined Strip Foundations

This is a combination of strip and drilled foundations, designed for even greater stability.

### When to Choose?

- when the fence is metal, segmental or wooden,
- when the soil is unstable,
- when additional reinforcement is needed.

### How Are They Installed?

- Strip foundations are poured,
- deeper and wider holes are dug at posts,
- reinforcement is placed both for foundations and posts.

This is an extremely strong solution for more complex plots.

## Hanging Foundations (Modular Foundations)

Hanging foundations are the most modern and rapidly gaining popularity choice.  
Suitable for these fences:

- steel,
- segmental,
- forged metal,
- net,
- wooden.

### Why Are They So Popular?

- **Manufactured in factory**, therefore quality is ensured.
- **No on-site concreting** – saves time and money.
- **Adapt to soil and weather conditions**, don't crack.
- **Aesthetic** – different colors can be chosen.
- **Easily installed** using special holders.
- Buried in ground about **10 cm**, while **8–10 cm** remain above ground.

This is an excellent choice for those seeking a tidy, modern and practical solution.
