# How to Choose the Perfect Fence According to Your Plot Terrain?

Fence selection is not just an aesthetic decision. It is a practical task that requires evaluating plot terrain, environmental conditions and territory specifics.  
If the plot is uneven, has slopes or other challenges, a properly chosen fence can not only improve aesthetics but also ensure maximum functionality.

Below – clear advice on how to choose a fence according to your plot terrain.

## Why is terrain so important when choosing a fence?

Plot terrain directly determines which type of fence will be most suitable.  
If the territory is uneven or has steep slopes, it is necessary to choose solutions that adapt to the terrain.

### **1. Adaptation to slopes**

On an uneven plot, **segment fences** work best because:

- they can be installed straight or stepped,
- segments easily adapt to terrain changes,
- gaps and unevenness at the bottom are avoided.

### **2. Stepped segments or "freely following" the slope**

There are two installation methods:

- **Stepping** – segments are installed in steps, suitable for steep slopes.
- **Following terrain** – segments are installed to smoothly follow the ground line.

Both methods allow maintaining aesthetics and stability.

### **3. Efficient territory utilization**

A properly planned fence:

- leaves no gaps,
- optimally uses plot area,
- ensures safety and unified perimeter.

## How do wind direction and sunlight affect fence selection?

Terrain is only part of the solution. Environmental conditions also have a big impact.

### **Wind resistance**

If the plot is open and windy:

- choose segments with smaller gaps,
- consider aerodynamic solutions,
- avoid completely solid structures if the territory is very windy.

### **Privacy and sun direction**

If you want more shade or privacy:

- choose denser segments,
- consider decorative elements,
- louvre-type fences perfectly filter light and provide privacy.

## Practical advice on how to choose the perfect fence

### **1. Trust professional measurements**

Using **3D measurement equipment**, it is possible to:

- accurately assess terrain,
- plan segment heights,
- avoid installation mistakes.

### **2. Consider plot size**

- For small plots – lighter segment fences.
- For large plots – more massive structures that visually don't get lost.

### **3. Match fence to environment**

- In green areas choose more natural, nature-close designs.
- In urban zones, minimalist, modern fences work perfectly.
