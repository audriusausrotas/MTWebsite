# Fence Netting for Animals – Are You Properly Maintaining This Fence Solution?

Fence netting is one of the most practical and economical solutions for large land or forest plot owners. It's perfect for pastures where sheep, cows, deer, horses or other animals are kept, as well as for territories that need protection from wild animals.  
However, even a strong, quality netting requires minimal but regular attention to remain functional and safe.

## Does Fence Netting Require Maintenance?

If the netting is installed professionally, additional technical maintenance is usually not needed.  
Nevertheless, due to animal behavior and environmental impact, **regular perimeter inspection is necessary**.

### Why Is This Important?

- animals kept in pastures can run into the netting, especially during rut or when frightened,
- wild animals may try to crawl, jump or get tangled,
- damaged netting can become dangerous both for your animals and for wild ones.

Regular inspection allows noticing damage in time and avoiding accidents.

## How Often to Check Fence Netting?

Ideally – **every day**, but if that's not possible, it's recommended to walk around the entire fence perimeter at least **once a week**.

Perimeter inspection includes:

- walking along the entire fence,
- visual assessment of netting condition,
- searching for damage, dents or tangles,
- checking post stability.

Damage noticed in time can save an animal's life and protect you from greater losses.

## Vegetation Control – Essential for Netting Longevity

Unmaintained vegetation can:

- get tangled in the netting and deform it,
- create hiding places for wild animals,
- increase netting load,
- cause netting to tip or crack.

### What to Do?

- regularly mow grass near the fence,
- remove bushes and branches,
- don't let vines or dense plants overgrow the netting.

This helps maintain netting strength and protects from additional damage.

## Don't Forget Gates and Wickets

Entrance points are the weakest part of any fence.  
Therefore it's necessary to regularly check:

- hinges,
- locks,
- latches,
- wicket stability.

Improperly closing gates can:

- let animals escape,
- create opportunity for predators to enter,
- leave the territory unprotected from outsiders.

Since netting is installed to ensure security, gate maintenance is just as important as the netting itself.

## Conclusion

Fence netting is a reliable and practical solution for animal protection, but its effectiveness directly depends on the owner's involvement.  
By regularly checking the perimeter, maintaining vegetation and ensuring gate safety, you will ensure that your sheep, horses, cows or deer are protected, and the territory is safe.
