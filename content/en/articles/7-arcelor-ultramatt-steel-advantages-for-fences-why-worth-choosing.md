## 1. Belgian-made steel – a quality standard you can trust

Arcelor is one of the largest and most reliable steel manufacturers in Europe.  
The UltraMatt line is produced in **Belgium**, where extremely strict quality standards apply:

- precise production processes,
- consistent quality control,
- stable results in every batch.

This means you get not a random product, but a **premium class steel** chosen by professionals throughout Europe.

---

## 2. 50-year warranty – durability that stands out in the market

Arcelor UltraMatt is provided with a **up to 50-year warranty**.  
This is one of the longest warranties among all steel fence materials.

What does this mean for you?

- the fence will not need replacement for decades,
- the steel will remain resistant to corrosion,
- color and surface will remain stable even in extreme conditions.

This is an investment that pays off not in 5 or 10 years, but **over a lifetime**.

---

## 3. 0.5 mm steel thickness – strong and stable choice

The steel thickness – **0.5 mm** – is optimal for fences:

- strong enough to withstand wind and mechanical impact,
- light enough not to cause excessive load on structures,
- maintains shape and does not wobble even after many years.

This is the thickness chosen by professional fence manufacturers seeking the best price-quality ratio.

---

## 4. 35 micron paint layer – UV resistance and color stability

UltraMatt coating has a **35 micron** thick paint layer – this is more than most standard market alternatives.

Advantages:

- color does not fade even in intense sunlight,
- surface is resistant to scratches,
- coating does not peel or crack,
- fence looks like new for a long time.

The matte surface also gives a luxurious impression – this is not shiny, but **solid-looking** steel.

---

## 5. 275 g/m² zinc coating – maximum corrosion protection

The steel is coated with a **275 g/m² zinc** layer – this is one of the highest indicators on the market.

Why is this important?

- zinc protects metal from rust,
- protects cut areas,
- extends the entire fence's service life,
- ensures resistance to moisture, snow, frost and salts.

This is especially relevant in Lithuania, where the climate is aggressive to metal structures.

---

## 6. UltraMatt texture – modern, solid and luxurious design

UltraMatt surface is not just a coating, but an **aesthetic solution**:

- deep, rich matte effect,
- does not shine in the sun,
- looks expensive and modern,
- perfectly matches dark facades, wood, concrete and minimalist architecture.

This is one of the most popular choices in contemporary projects where visual unity is important.

---

## 7. Minimal maintenance requirements – a fence that won't cause worries

Unlike wooden fences, Arcelor UltraMatt:

- does not require painting,
- does not require impregnation,
- is easily washed by rain,
- remains aesthetic without additional investment.

This is the ideal choice for those who want a **beautiful but maintenance-free** fence.
