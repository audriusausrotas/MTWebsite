# Sliding or Swing Yard Gates – Which Are Suitable for Me?

Having decided to install a fence, it's necessary to think about yard gates in advance. From them depends not only territory security but also convenience and overall yard functionality.  
Most often two gate types are chosen – **sliding (cantilever)** and **swing (hinged)** gates. Both solutions have their advantages, but the most suitable option depends on your yard layout and needs.

It's important to decide the gate type before starting fence installation – you may need to lay wires for automation, adjust terrain or remove plants that interfere with installation.

## Swing Yard Gates

Swing gates are a classic solution made of two frames hinged on hinges. They can open:

- into the yard,
- to the outside,
- or mixed – one leaf inward, the other outward.

### Construction and Durability

Swing gate strength depends on:

- properly chosen **fence posts**,
- quality **hinges**,
- correctly calculated **gate weight**.

If posts or hinges are chosen too weak, the gates may not withstand wind, snow or intensive use.

### Advantages

- simple use even without automation,
- classic appearance,
- easily matched to various fence types.

### What to Pay Attention To?

Swing gates require **free zone for opening**.  
It is recommended:

- that gates open into the yard,
- mark the opening perimeter in the yard,
- plan car parking spaces so that gates don't obstruct them.

## Sliding Yard Gates

Sliding gates are rapidly gaining popularity due to modern design and practicality.  
They move sideways along the fence, therefore **do not take up yard space**.

### Main Advantages

- do not take up additional space in the yard,
- convenient for car maneuvering,
- suitable for narrower yards,
- weight is distributed evenly – posts and hinges are not stressed,
- can be made very long (up to 10 m), therefore perfect also for companies.

### Space Requirements

For gates to fully open, enough space along the fence is needed.  
The calculation is simple:

**gate length × 1.5 = required free space in driveway**

### Construction Advantages

Sliding gates **have no track on the ground**, therefore:

- do not clog with leaves, snow or ice,
- no need to clean track in winter,
- gates move easily and smoothly.

## Gate Automation

Both gate types can be supplemented with automation, which provides more security and convenience.

Possible control methods:

- **remote control**,
- **GSM module** – gates opened by call,
- **Wi-Fi module** – control via phone app even when not at home.

Automation is especially useful if gates are used frequently or you want to control access to the territory.
