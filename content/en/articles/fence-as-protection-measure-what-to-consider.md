# Fence as Protection Measure: What to Consider?

Maintaining safe property is one of the most important things to avoid problems at home. A fence is not just an aesthetic element but an effective passive protection measure that often provides more real benefits than alarms or cameras.  
For a fence to actually increase security, several essential criteria must be considered.

## Fence Height – First Security Factor

Too low a fence will not provide sufficient protection, while too high a fence can create an uncomfortable "enclosure" feeling. The optimal choice in most cases is **about 2 meters**:

- passersby don't see what's happening in the yard,
- climbing such a fence is much more difficult,
- balance between security and aesthetics is maintained.

If you want to build a fence higher than 2 m, you must obtain a municipality-issued **building permit document (SLD)**.

## Fence Opacity – Privacy and Security Combination

To ensure privacy and protection, it's important to choose the right fence type. One of the most effective solutions is **louvre (lamellar) fence**, made from German ThyssenKrupp AG steel.

The uniqueness of this fence:

- people outside **cannot see** what's happening in the yard,
- residents inside **can see the outside**,
- can notice danger in time and react.

This is an excellent choice when you want privacy but also security.

## Automatic Yard Gate System – Essential Security Part

Even the strongest fence will not be effective if yard entrances are not properly protected.  
Therefore it's important to ensure:

- secure entrance gate lock,
- reliable driveway gate mechanism.

**Automatic yard gates**:

- automatically lock the driveway,
- open only with remote control, call or mobile app,
- reduce the risk of gates being left unlocked.

## Choosing Suitable Fence Construction for Children or Pets

### Child Safety

Children are curious and active, so it's important to choose a fence that:

- has no horizontal elements that could be climbed,
- is sufficiently high,
- has vertical fence panels that make climbing difficult.

Vertical fence panel fence is one of the safest choices for families with small children.

### Pet Safety

When choosing a fence for pets, it's important to consider their breed and behavior.

#### Small Breed Dogs

- usually don't damage segmental or net fences,
- but may look for gaps under the fence,
- therefore **hanging foundations** are recommended.

#### Hunting Dogs

- tend to dig holes and chase animals,
- hanging foundations help prevent escapes,
- also protect from wild animals entering the yard.

#### Large Breed Dogs

- may try to jump over the fence,
- therefore it's necessary to choose a **sufficiently high** fence,
- if height exceeds 2 m – SLD is required.

## Conclusion

A fence can become one of the most effective home protection measures, but only if chosen responsibly.  
Height, opacity, gate system and suitable construction for children or pets – these are the main aspects that determine whether the fence will actually perform its function.
