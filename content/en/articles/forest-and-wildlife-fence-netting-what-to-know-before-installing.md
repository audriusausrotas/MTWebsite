## How is Fence Netting Installed?

Fence netting installation is simpler than other fence types, so many install it themselves.

### Installation kit consists of:

- fence netting,
- posts (metal or wooden).

### Recommended posts:

- **galvanized metal posts** – durable and resistant,
- **treated wooden posts** – economical and natural solution.

Wooden posts are usually round and driven directly into the ground.

### Most important installation part – netting tension

Even quality netting loses meaning if not properly tensioned.  
Poorly tensioned netting:

- is easily torn by animals,
- quickly deforms,
- does not perform protective function.

Therefore, when installing, it's necessary to pay much attention to proper tension.

Properly installed netting will serve for many years and ensure peace and safety.
