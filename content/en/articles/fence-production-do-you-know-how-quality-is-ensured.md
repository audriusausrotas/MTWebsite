# Fence Production: Do You Know How Quality Is Ensured?

When choosing a plot enclosure solution, the natural question arises – what technologies do fence masters use and how is it ensured that the fence will be durable, safe and aesthetic?  
Fence production and installation is a process that requires precision, experience and modern equipment. Production quality directly affects your property's security, privacy and overall plot appearance.

Below we review the main fence production stages and quality assurance principles.

## 1. 3D Plot Design – Foundation of Precision

Before starting production, a **3D plot project** is performed.  
Although not all fence masters offer this service, it is extremely important, especially for non-standard plots.

3D project allows:

- accurately assess plot terrain,
- plan fence height and layout,
- visually see how the fence and gates will look,
- calculate precise project estimate already during the first measurement.

This helps avoid mistakes and ensures that production starts with a clear plan.

## 2. Steel Fence Production – Quality Materials and Resistance

The second stage – production of the chosen fence model.  
For the fence to maintain its original appearance and be resistant to weather conditions, it's necessary to choose high-quality steel.

### Why is Steel Quality Important?

Premium class **Thyssenkrupp AG** steel:

- produced in one of Europe's largest factories,
- coated with zinc layer,
- powder-coated according to RAL palette,
- has **up to 45-year warranty**.

Zinc layer protects from corrosion, while powder coating ensures color durability and resistance to UV rays, rain, snow and temperature fluctuations.

## 3. Steel Panel Production – Precision with CNC Technologies

The third stage – forming steel panels.  
For this, **automated CNC steel bending machines** are used, which allow:

- achieve precise fence profile,
- ensure uniform product quality,
- produce panels quickly and precisely,
- adapt production speed according to fence type.

CNC technologies guarantee that each segment will be identical and meet the parameters set during design.

## Why Choose Masters Who Perform the Entire Process?

The best results are achieved when one team:

- designs,
- produces,
- installs the fence, gates and wickets.

This way:

- communication errors are avoided,
- quality control is ensured at all stages,
- the client doesn't have to worry about intermediate solutions,
- the process runs smoothly and without stress.

Experienced fence masters take care of everything from idea to final result, and you just enjoy the new, quality fence.
