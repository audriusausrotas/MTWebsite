## 1. Exclusive protective coating "Pladur® Wrinkle Mat"

Thyssenkrupp steel is coated with **Pladur® Wrinkle Mat** coating, which:

- lasts up to **45 years**,
- has a **36 micron** thick protective layer,
- effectively protects from UV rays, moisture, frost and other environmental factors.

This is one of the most durable coatings on the market, ensuring long-term fence protection.

## 2. ZM Ecoprotect® technology – double corrosion protection

The steel is coated with a **zinc and magnesium alloy**, which:

- provides much greater corrosion resistance than standard zinc coating,
- protects even in aggressive environments,
- extends the steel's service life.

Magnesium strengthens the protective layer, so the steel remains resistant even to intense environmental impact.

## 3. Color compatibility even after many years

One of the exclusive Thyssenkrupp advantages – **color stability**.  
If after several years you want to:

- extend the fence,
- replace a segment,
- update part of the structure,

you will get an **identical shade** that will not differ from the existing one.  
Most manufacturers cannot guarantee this.

## 4. Strong and practical 0.5 mm steel thickness

The steel thickness – **0.5 mm** – provides:
