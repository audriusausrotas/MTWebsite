# Is Steel Fence Maintenance Required?

More and more people are looking for a fencing solution that would be resistant to weather conditions, not require complex maintenance and remain aesthetic for many years. Steel fences meet these expectations perfectly – they are resistant to wind, frost, heat, precipitation and ultraviolet rays.  
However, even the strongest steel fence requires **minimal but regular maintenance** to maintain its original appearance and protection against corrosion.

## Why does steel fence need maintenance?

Steel fences are made of galvanized steel and powder-coated. Such coating:

- protects from corrosion,
- extends the fence's service life,
- allows providing up to **45-year warranty**.

However, even quality coating does not protect against all risks.  
For example:

- a fallen branch can scratch the surface,
- impact can damage the paint layer,
- moisture can accumulate in certain places.

Therefore minimal maintenance is necessary.

## Fence maintenance throughout the year – minimal but necessary

Steel fence does not require as much maintenance as wooden ones, but it is worth washing regularly.  
In spring, summer and autumn it is recommended to:

- wash away the layer of earth, dirt and dust,
- remove dirt that can damage the surface,
- check for small scratches.

This helps maintain aesthetic appearance and protect against damage that spreads over time.

## Regularly trim trees and shrubs

After strong winds, branches often fall on the fence or leaning bushes rest against it.  
It is important:

- immediately remove branches,
- check if the fence is not dented or scratched,
- do not let plants rest against the fence.

Fallen branches can damage the steel and promote corrosion.

## Do not plant vegetation against the fence

Although a planted fence may look decorative, plants can:

- rest against the fence and deform it,
- retain moisture,
- promote corrosion,
- complicate maintenance.

Therefore plant plants **away from the fence** so they do not touch the structure.

## Do not accumulate autumn leaves near the fence

In autumn, it is a common habit to sweep leaves into the yard.  
However, leaf piles:

- retain moisture,
- can damage fence posts,
- promote rusting and deformation.

Leaves should be **collected and removed**, not left near the fence.

## Do not store items along the fence

The fence should not be used as:

- support for garden tools,
- place for children's toys,
- hook for small items.

In winter, snow accumulating on items can be too heavy and damage the fence.  
Keep items away from the fence.

## Fence maintenance in winter – clear snow drifts

In winter it is necessary:

- clear snow along the fence,
- not let moisture accumulate,
- ensure the fence can dry.

Increased moisture levels in winter can negatively affect the fence's exterior and accelerate corrosion processes.
