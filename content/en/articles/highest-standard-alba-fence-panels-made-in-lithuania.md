## ALBA Fence Panels Made in Lithuania

ALBA fence panels were born from real customer needs.  
Working with residents from various regions for many years, three most important criteria emerged:

- **quality**,
- **durability**,
- **universality**.

Considering these expectations, we created ALBA fence panels – a solution that meets the highest technological standards and perfectly adapts to different architectural styles.

### Highest production quality

ALBA fence panels are manufactured using:

- innovative steel bending machines,
- precise production processes,
- polymer coating that protects against corrosion and climate impact.

This coating ensures that fence panels remain resistant to rain, snow, UV rays and temperature fluctuations.

## ALBA Design – Lightness and Universality

ALBA fence panels stand out with subtle bends that give the model lightness and modernity.  
Due to their design, they perfectly match:

- with wooden homesteads,
- with modern city houses,
- with commercial buildings,
- with various architectural styles.

Fence panels can be **powder-coated** according to **RAL color palette**, so they are easily matched to the roof, facade or other territory elements.

### 2. Easy maintenance

To maintain perfect fence condition, it's enough to:

This is one of the least maintenance-requiring fence solutions.

### 3. Ability to regulate privacy level

ALBA fence panels allow choosing:

- **single-sided** arrangement – more light, less opacity,

This gives complete control over what level of privacy you want on your plot.
