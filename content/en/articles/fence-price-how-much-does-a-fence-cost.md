# Fence Price – How Much Does a Fence Cost?

As soon as you decide to enclose your plot, one of the first questions that arises for everyone – **how much will a fence cost?**  
Fence calculators on the internet can help find preliminary price ranges, but the real fence price depends on many factors.  
To make the right decision, it's worth understanding what actually determines the final project estimate.

## 1. Fence Model – One of the Most Important Price-Determining Factors

Fence price directly depends on the chosen fence type. Most commonly chosen models:

- **segmental fence** – economical solution suitable for marking plot boundaries or protecting from wild animals,
- **louvre type fence** – excellent choice when you want both security and privacy,
- **polisade fence** – modern, aesthetic solution,
- **fence panel fence** – classic variant suitable for various plots.

Each model performs different functions, so it's important to clearly understand your needs first.

### Why Do Some Fences Cost More?

Metal fence prices increase due to:

- larger quantity of steel panels (especially in louvre type fences),
- high-quality materials,
- galvanized and powder-coated surface.

Such solutions ensure durability and corrosion resistance.

## 2. Plot Border Length

The larger the plot, the more materials are needed to install the fence.  
Longer borders mean:

- more segments or fence panels,
- more posts,
- longer installation time.

Therefore, plot size is one of the main price-determining factors.

---

## 3. Fence Height

Fence height also has a direct impact on price:

- **the higher the fence, the more materials are needed**,
- in case of louvre and other metal fences – more steel panels.

It's important to know:

- to build a **higher than 2 m** fence, a municipality-issued **building permit document (SLD)** is necessary.

Therefore, before choosing height, it's worth verifying if such a fence can be installed on your plot.

## 4. Plot Terrain

Plot unevenness can have a great impact on fence price.  
If the height difference between plots is **30–50 cm or more**, you may need:

- concrete supporting wall,
- form slopes,
- use additional structures.

To accurately assess terrain, a **plot 3D plan** is created during the first measurement.  
It allows seeing not only terrain features but also the future fence appearance.

## 5. Yard Gates and Their Control

The fence project often includes gate installation.  
Price depends on:

### Gate Type:

- **sliding (cantilever)** – saves space but is more expensive,
- **swing (hinged)** – classic and simpler solution.

### Control Method:

- gate automation,
- remote control by call or app,
- integration with intercom.

Each choice has different hardware and installation specifications, so it can increase the total project price.

## Conclusion: What Does the Final Fence Price Depend On?

Fence price is determined by:

- chosen fence model,
- plot border length,
- fence height,
- plot terrain,
- gate type and control.

For these reasons, **the exact price is determined only after the first measurement**, when all technical aspects are assessed.  
If you want to find preliminary price ranges, you can use the **fence calculator**.
