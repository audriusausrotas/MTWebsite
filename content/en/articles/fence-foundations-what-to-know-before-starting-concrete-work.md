# Fence Foundations – What to Know Before Starting Concrete Work?

When planning fence installation, one of the most important stages is choosing suitable fence foundations. The fence's stability, durability and resistance to environmental impact depend on them.  
Whether the fence is for a private yard or commercial territory – properly chosen foundations are a necessary condition for a successful project.  
Let's discuss what to consider before starting foundation pouring or installation work.

## Fence Foundations and Soil

Soil type has a great influence on which foundations will be most suitable.

### Sandy Soil

Sand is less stable, therefore it's recommended to choose:

- **drilled foundations**,
- **strip monolithic (concrete) foundations**.

These solutions ensure better holding and protect the fence from settling or distortion.

### Clay Soil

Clay tends to retain moisture, therefore:

- water can damage the structure,
- corrosion can start,
- posts become unstable over time.

In this case, it's necessary to:

- **deeply concrete the posts**,
- install **drainage** to regulate moisture level.

### Rocky Soil

Although rare in Lithuania, rocky ground complicates digging work.  
In such cases, often chosen:

- **surface foundations with holders**,
- minimally invasive solutions without deep digging.

## Underground Pipelines and Electrical Utilities

Before starting any digging work, it's necessary to clarify:

- whether **water supply** runs under the plot,
- **gas pipeline**,
- **sewerage system**,
- **electrical cables**.

A hole dug too deep can damage utilities and cause serious problems not only for you but also for neighbors or the entire quarter.  
This is one of the most important steps that cannot be skipped.

## Fence Height and Structure

Fence height and weight directly determine what foundations are needed.

### High and Heavy Fences

Required:

- **strong concrete foundations**,
- greater concreting depth,
- thicker posts.

This ensures the fence won't collapse in strong wind or snow load.

### Hanging (Modular) Foundations

Modern hanging foundations can be used for higher fences as well.  
They:

- adapt to soil changes,
- don't require complex pouring,
- are quickly installed.

This is an excellent alternative if you don't want traditional concrete foundations.

## Long-term Fence Foundation Maintenance

Different foundation types require different maintenance.

### Strip Monolithic Foundations

- can **crack** due to frost,
- cracks accumulate moisture,
- it's necessary to periodically inspect and seal damaged areas.

### Hanging Foundations

- require **minimal maintenance**,
- structure adapts to ground movement,
- doesn't accumulate moisture, therefore serves longer.

## Why Consult with Specialists?

Every plot is individual – terrain, soil, utilities and fence type differ.  
Professional fence masters:

- evaluate your plot conditions,
- choose the most suitable foundation type,
- ensure correct installation.

As the saying goes – **the stingy pay twice**.  
Improperly installed foundations can cause many additional expenses in the future.
