## 1. Regular cleaning

In summer, the fence constantly faces environmental factors:

- dust,
- dirt,
- pollen,
- bird droppings,
- tree sap.

These dirt not only spoil the aesthetic view but can also damage the fence surface if left for long.

### How to clean?

- use **mild detergent and water**,
- or **high-pressure washer**,
- remove stubborn dirt with **soft brush or sponge**,
- after cleaning **rinse well** so no detergent residue remains.

Regular cleaning helps maintain the fence's color and protective layer.

## 2. Regular fence inspection

Summer is a great time to check the fence's condition.  
Check for:

- loose parts,
- missing post caps,
- dents or scratches,
- signs of corrosion.

It is especially important to check **post caps** – if they are missing, water will accumulate inside, which will inevitably cause rust.

### For wooden fences:

- replace damaged boards,
- tighten bolts,
- ensure protection against rot.

Problems noticed should be solved immediately so they don't turn into expensive repairs.

## 3. Vegetation control

In summer, plants grow especially fast, but vegetation growing too close to the fence can damage it.

### Why is this important?

- branches and bushes can **scratch the surface**,
- plants retain **moisture**, which promotes corrosion,
- vines can deform the structure.

### What to do?

- regularly **trim bushes and tree branches**,
- do not plant the fence with greenery that will rest against it,
- remove **weeds and grass** around the fence base.

This helps avoid moisture accumulation and mechanical damage.

## 4. Moisture protection

Although summer is usually dry, rains and moisture spikes can damage the fence.

### For wooden fences:

- use **waterproof sealant**,
- protect against rot and mold.

### For steel and metal fences:

- ensure **proper drainage**,
- do not let water accumulate at the fence base,
- watch for places where moisture accumulates.

Proper moisture control helps avoid deformation and corrosion.
