## Reliable Fence Masters – Foundation of Successful Construction

It's recommended to start fence construction by finding professional masters. When choosing specialists, it's worth paying attention to:

- customer reviews,
- company communication on social networks,
- duration of activity and experience,
- estimate detail,
- clearly stated work deadlines.

Reliable masters actively communicate with clients, share insights, answer questions and help avoid mistakes.

Don't reinvent the wheel – consult with specialists and solve the most important questions before starting work.

## Fence Construction Requirements: Location and Height

Before choosing fence design, it's necessary to familiarize yourself with current requirements. They define:

- fence height,
- opacity (density),
- installation location on the plot.

These requirements are designed to not worsen the situation on the neighboring plot – not block sun, not obstruct surface water runoff.

### When Is Neighbor Consent Needed?

If:

- the fence is installed **closer than 1 m** from the plot border,
- fence elements cross the border,
- the base can obstruct water runoff,

— **written consent of the neighboring plot owner** is necessary.

### When Is Building Permit (SLD) Needed?

If:

- the fence will be **higher than 2 meters**.

In this case, you need to apply to the municipality for a building permit document.

## Fence Design Selection

The fence model must meet not only aesthetic but also technical requirements.  
Design selection depends on:

- plot's geographical location,
- bordering with neighbors,
- privacy needs.

Opacity requirements apply to bordering fences:

- **northern side** – not less than **50 %**,
- **east and west sides** – not less than **25 %**.

Fence masters will help evaluate which model best meets your needs and requirements.

## Yard Gates and Wicket Selection

Fence construction often includes gates and wicket installation.  
Two main gate types are possible:

### **1. Sliding (Cantilever) Gates**

- save space in the yard,
- perfect for narrower plots.

### **2. Swing (Hinged) Gates**

- classic solution,
- suitable for larger plots.

Masters will help plan gate location and size so they don't obstruct fence structure and are convenient to use.  
If gate position is not properly evaluated, there may not be enough space to open them.

## Intercom Installation – Convenience and Security

An intercom is a step towards smarter and more convenient homes.  
An intercom provides:

- additional security,
- convenience when you don't need to go to the door,
- ability to control gates remotely.

However, this solution must be planned **in advance**, before starting fence construction.  
You need to:

- lay necessary cables,
- choose suitable intercom model,
- coordinate its location with gate structure.

Fence masters can advise which solution best meets your needs.

## Conclusion

Fence construction is a process that requires proper preparation.  
By choosing reliable masters, evaluating requirements, planning design, gates and intercom, you can avoid mistakes and ensure that the fence will serve long, look aesthetic and perform all its functions.
