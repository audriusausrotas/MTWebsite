## Steel Fence Panels – Excellent Choice for Those Seeking Privacy and Security

Fence panel fence is made of strong, durable German **ThyssenKrupp AG** steel, which is given even a **45-year warranty**.  
This is an extremely reliable solution that can withstand:

- impacts,
- strong wind,
- rain,
- sun heat,
- temperature fluctuations.

The steel is:

- **galvanized**,
- **powder-coated**,
- all **RAL colors** available, so the fence is easily matched to the roof, facade or other plot elements.

Due to quality coating, fence panels do not require complex maintenance – it's enough to periodically wash away dust and ensure that vegetation does not rest against the fence.
