When planning to enclose a plot, it's often not considered that certain plots have specific restrictions. One of the most common cases – when the plot borders with a **servitude road** or **drainage system**.

## Fence Construction Near Servitude Road or Street

**Road servitude** is the right to use a certain part of a land plot that belongs to another owner. Servitude can be intended for:

- pedestrian passage,
- vehicle passage,
- utility network installation,
- other public needs.

Servitudes are established by:

- notarized transactions,
- court decisions,
- laws or administrative acts.

### Why Is This Important for Fence Construction?

If the plot plan marks a servitude road, the fence **cannot**:

- block passage,
- restrict passage,
- obstruct utility network maintenance,
- be built in the servitude zone.

### Common Mistake

The servitude width in reality can differ from what appears "by eye".  
For example, a 4 m wide road in the plan can be marked as an **8 m servitude zone**.  
If a fence is built in this zone – the municipality can obligate its removal.

### What to Do?

- apply to the municipality for an **exact servitude plan**,
- review the **detailed plot plan**,
- coordinate the location with specialists before building the fence.

Most often – due to not knowing exactly where:

- drainage pipes,
- drainage ditch,

- drainage capacity.

### What Must Be Done Before Building Fence?

- contact municipality specialists responsible for drainage,
- clarify the **exact drainage location**,
- determine water flow direction,
- evaluate how the fence can affect water runoff.

### Why Is This Important?

Fence masters, knowing the drainage location, can:

- choose suitable fence height,
- leave space for water runoff,
- choose suitable foundation type,
- avoid drainage damage.
