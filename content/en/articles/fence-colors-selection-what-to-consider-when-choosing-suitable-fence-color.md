# Fence Colors Selection: What to Consider When Choosing Suitable Fence Color?

Your plot is like a canvas where each element creates the overall picture. A fence is one of the brightest accents of this composition, therefore a properly chosen color can connect all territory elements into a harmonious whole or become a distinctive contrasting accent.  
Before choosing a color, it's worth clearly defining what effect you're seeking – subtle blending into environment or a bright visual accent.

Steel fences, such as louvre, diamond, spruce, polisade or fence panel fences, are made from durable German **Thyssenkrupp AG** steel and powder-coated according to a wide **RAL color palette**. This provides the opportunity to choose both classic and distinctive colors.

## Should the Fence Be an Accent or a Subtle Detail?

The first step – decide what role the fence will play in your environment.

### If You Want the Fence Not to Stand Out

Choose:

- earthy tones,
- darker colors,
- shades that naturally blend with environment.

This is especially relevant if the fence is only for territory protection, for example, from wild animals. Such colors don't create contrast and don't interrupt the natural landscape.

### If the Fence Should Become an Accent

You can choose:

- black,
- white,
- graphite,
- brown,
- other brighter tones.

A brighter fence can give the territory modernity, structure and visual distinctiveness.

## Fence Color and Vegetation: How to Maintain Balance?

If you have many plants in your yard, it's important to choose a color that won't overwhelm them and won't blend with the background.

### What to Avoid?

- colors identical to vegetation (e.g., bright green),
- tones that "swallow" plant contours.

In this case, plants become less visible, and the yard view loses depth.

### What Works Best?

- black,
- white,
- brown,
- graphite color,
- other contrasting tones.

Such colors help highlight greenery and create a tidy, aesthetic background.

## Matching Fence Colors with Buildings and Other Elements

Most often, fence color is matched to:

- roofing,
- facade color,
- window frames,
- clinker finish,
- brick fence posts.

### If Buildings Are Decorated with Clinker

It's recommended to choose:

- brown,
- gray,
- graphite shades.

Such tones naturally match clinker texture and color range.

### Matching with Neighborhood

A harmonious neighborhood view is also important.  
If a certain color direction dominates in the environment, it's worth maintaining it – this creates a unified architectural character.

## Why Is Fence Color So Important?

A properly chosen color:

- improves the entire territory's aesthetics,
- increases plot value,
- strengthens architectural style,
- leaves a good impression on guests,
- helps maintain visual order.

A fence is not just protection but also an important visual part of your home, therefore color choice has a great influence on the overall image.
