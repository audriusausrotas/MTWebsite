## Louvre Fence – Most Popular Steel Fence Type

Privacy is one of the main reasons why people choose to enclose their plot. Louvre (lamellar) fence is one of the best solutions when you want both security and aesthetics.

### How Does Louvre Fence Work?

Louvre fence is made from steel, bending horizontal grooves at a special angle.  
Due to this construction:

- **from outside the fence looks solid**,
- **from inside – more open and transparent**,
- passersby don't see the yard,
- you see what happens beyond the fence boundaries.

This provides privacy but also allows feeling safe.

### Air Circulation and Light

Louvre fence is characterized by air permeability, therefore:

- does not create greenhouse effect,
- does not dry out plants near the fence,
- allows sun rays to enter.

This is especially relevant for greenery enthusiasts.

### "Spruce" Type Louvre Fence

If you want complete opacity, you can choose **Spruce type louvre fence**:

- it is equally solid from both sides,
- ensures maximum privacy level,
- however **does not let air through**, so it's not suitable for places where air circulation is important.
