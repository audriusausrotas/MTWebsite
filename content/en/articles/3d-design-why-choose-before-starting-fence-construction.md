# 3D Design – Why Choose It Before Starting Fence Construction?

Although there are plenty of fence masters in Lithuania, only a small fraction of them offer **3D plot design services**.  
This is one of the most important steps if you want to precisely plan fence construction, avoid mistakes and see the final result before starting work.  
3D design allows for accurate representation of the plot's terrain, assessment of challenges and planning of the entire fence and gate installation process.

## Why is 3D design necessary to achieve precise results?

### Precise estimates already during the first consultation

A well-prepared 3D project allows:

- accurate calculation of required materials,
- assessment of labor costs,
- creation of a clear and precise project estimate.

This helps avoid unexpected expenses during construction and allows the client to know the entire project cost in advance.

---

### Final fence and gate visualization

3D design provides the opportunity to **see the future fence on the real plot**:

- how the chosen fence model will look,
- whether the height is appropriate,
- how colors and materials match,
- how the fence blends into the environment.

This helps make informed decisions and avoid doubts, unnecessary transportation of samples or choosing inappropriate design.

---

### Optimal space utilization

3D project allows for precise planning of the fence location on the plot:

- maximum utilization of available space,
- identification of obstacles (trees, plantings, terrain irregularities),
- assessment of underground and overhead utility lines,
- advance planning of more complex installation points.

This ensures a smooth work process and reduces the risk of having to change plans during construction.

---

### Project personalization

Every plot and every client's needs are unique.  
3D design allows:

- testing different fence models,
- changing colors, height, materials,
- combining gates, wickets and other elements,
- creating an individual solution adapted to the plot.

Visualization helps make decisions more easily and find the ideal option.

---

### Compliance with requirements

In Lithuania, certain regulations apply to fence construction.  
For example:

- fences **over 2 meters** high require a **building permit (SLD)**.

3D project allows advance verification that:

- the fence complies with legal acts,
- plot boundaries are not violated,
- potential legal problems or the need to reinstall the fence are avoided.

---

### Fewer mistakes and additional expenses

3D design allows:

- anticipating all possible obstacles,
- avoiding installation mistakes,
- reducing the risk of expensive corrections,
- ensuring precise and quality results.

This is one of the most effective ways to save both time and money.

---

### Peace of mind and a clear plan

Having a 3D project before starting work, you know:

- how the final result will look,
- what work will be performed,
- how much everything will cost,
- what deadlines await.

This provides peace of mind and confidence throughout the entire project process.
