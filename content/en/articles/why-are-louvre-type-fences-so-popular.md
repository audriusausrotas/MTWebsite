# Why Are Louvre-Type Fences So Popular?

When looking for plot enclosure solutions, more and more people choose not only a secure but also a modern, environment-matching fence. Aesthetics today is as important as functionality, therefore steel fences, especially louvre-type, are rapidly gaining popularity.  
Let's see why exactly louvre fences have become one of the most desirable choices.

## Louvre Fences Are Made from Reliable and Durable Steel

Louvre (lamellar) fences are characterized by universal design that easily matches various architectural styles – from modern houses to classic construction.  
They are made from:

- **galvanized steel**,
- **powder-coated**,
- **all RAL colors available**,
- **German ThyssenKrupp AG steel**, which is given even a **45-year warranty**.

Such combination ensures corrosion resistance, color durability and aesthetic appeal for many years.

## Unique Steel Bending Technology – Privacy Without Enclosure

One of the biggest advantages of louvre fences is their construction.  
Special steel bending technology allows:

- **not seeing from outside** what is happening in the yard,
- **seeing from inside** what is happening beyond the plot boundaries.

This provides privacy but also allows feeling safe and observing potential dangers.

### Adjustable Opacity

When the plot borders with a neighbor, different opacity solutions can be chosen:

- **standard louvre fence** – visibility only from inside,
- **"spruce" type louvre fence** – completely opaque from both sides.

The "spruce" type fence is ideal when complete privacy is desired and perfectly matches traditional louvre fence.

## Louvre Fence Advantage – Natural Air Circulation

Unlike solid steel fences, louvre construction:

- does not block air movement,
- allows soil to dry naturally,
- does not create greenhouse effect,
- does not prevent sun rays from entering the plot.

For this reason, greenery can be planted near louvre fence, as they receive enough light and moisture.

### Exception – "Spruce" Type Louvre Fence

Since this fence is completely opaque, planting greenery near it is **not recommended**, because:

- sun rays do not penetrate,
- plants may suffer from lack of light.
