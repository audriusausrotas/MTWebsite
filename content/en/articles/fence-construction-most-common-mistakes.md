# Fence Construction: Most Common Mistakes

When starting a new project, especially one you have no experience with, it's natural not to know all possible nuances. Fence construction is no exception – without specific knowledge, you can make mistakes that later cost more than the fence itself.  
Let's discuss the most common mistakes and how to avoid them.

## Unsuitable Fence Posts

Posts are one of the most important fence structure elements. Whether you choose polisade, louvre, spruce type or fence panel fence – **posts determine fence stability, durability and longevity**.

### Common Mistakes:

### **1. Too Thin Diameter Posts**

Too narrow posts:

- don't support greater weight,
- can deform,
- become weak support for gates.

It's recommended to choose **larger diameter posts** to ensure a strong base.

### **2. Insufficient Quality Materials**

Posts must be:

- made from quality metal,
- coated with zinc **inside and outside**.

Only this way can corrosion be avoided and longevity ensured.

### **3. Not Replacing Missing Post Cap**

This is one of the most dangerous but often ignored mistakes.  
Without a cap, the following enters the post:

- water,
- dirt,
- moisture.

This causes corrosion and deformation. The cap must be replaced immediately.

### **4. Incorrect Post Installation Depth**

Posts must be concreted:

- **about 60 cm deep**,
- or **one-third of their length**.

Posts concreted too shallowly won't withstand wind and other loads.

## Ignoring Underground Utilities

Before starting fence installation, it's necessary to clarify whether the plot has:

- electrical cables,
- gas pipes,
- water supply,
- other utility networks.

Since posts require digging deep holes, not knowing utility locations can:

- damage pipes,
- create danger to yourself and neighbors,
- incur large losses.

## Incorrectly Left Gap Between Ground and Fence

Another common mistake – incorrectly chosen gap between ground and fence bottom.

### Too Small Gap:

- difficult to mow grass,
- moisture and dirt accumulate.

### Too Large Gap:

- wild animals can crawl under,
- small breed dogs or cats can escape.

Optimal gap – **about 5 cm**.

## Conclusion

These are just some of the most common fence construction mistakes.  
To avoid them, it's worth consulting with experienced fence masters – they will help make the right decisions and ensure that the fence is installed qualitatively and durably.
