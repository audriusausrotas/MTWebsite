# How to choose the ideal fence for your landscape

Choosing a fence is not only an aesthetic decision but also a practical task that requires considering the specifics of your land. If your plot has uneven terrain or challenging environmental conditions, selecting the right fence can be difficult. However, properly chosen fence segments can enhance the aesthetics of your territory and ensure functionality.

## Why is terrain important when choosing a fence?

The terrain of your land is one of the main factors determining the right fence choice. If your territory is uneven or has slopes:

### Adapting to slopes

Uneven terrain requires flexible solutions – segment fences adapt perfectly to these conditions.

### Stepped segments or slope‑following installation

Fence segments can be installed either straight or in a stepped pattern, depending on your needs.

### Efficient use of space

A well‑planned fence helps you use your territory efficiently without leaving unprotected areas.

## How wind direction and sunlight affect your fence choice

Wind and sunlight are two additional factors to consider:

### Wind resistance

If your plot is in an open area, choose fence segments that are less affected by wind, such as those with smaller gaps or aerodynamic designs.

### Privacy from sunlight

If you want more shade or privacy, choose denser segments or add decorative elements.

## Practical tips for choosing the ideal fence

### Rely on professional measurements

### Consider the size of your plot

Smaller plots often benefit from lighter segment fences, while larger ones may require more massive constructions.

### Environment matters

If you live in a green area, choose a fence design that blends with nature. In urban environments, minimalist solutions are usually the best.
